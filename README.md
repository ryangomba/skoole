A better way to buy & sell textbooks

## Pitch

Today we'd like to talk about a problem facing most of us in this room...

Buying and selling textbooks sucks.

- You can buy and sell textbooks from the bookstore, but you know you're getting ripped off.
- You can rent textbooks from Chegg, but you're still get ripped off.
- You can buy and sell from Amazon or Half.com, but these merchants take a sizable cut. Plus, you need to buy padded envelopes, print shipping labels, and you might wait over a week to receive your books.

MONEY

On Tuesday I  witnessed a girl - her name was Laura - ship a textbook from the Georgia Tech Post Office... to the Georgia Tech Post Office! Another Tech student had bought this textbook through Amazon. Amazon took 10 bucks from the transaction and it cost Laura 5 dollars to ship the book. Plus, the cashier told Laura the book would need to travel to the Atlanta distribution facility 5 miles away before it could be delivered at the Georgia Tech Package Center 10 feet from where Laura was standing.

This kind of thing is ridiculous, but it happens all the time!

When I sell a textbook, I know there's a buyer on campus. I just don't know who they are. That's why we built Skoole.

And we'd like to demo it to you now.

-----------------------

To start, I go to Skoole.com

I enter my .edu email address to identify my school, and my phone number.

Then, I simply list the books I need to buy and the ones I have to sell.

(I'll just list one book to buy right now. Organic Chemistry.)

imum condition I'd like the book to be in, and a maximum price I'm willing to pay for it. And BOOM - I'm done. Really, that's it.

Because Skoole will look for a match and notify me when it find one. Ah - I've got a text!

"Would you like to buy Organic Chemistry in new condition from Doug for $50?"

That sounds like a good deal, so I'll say "yeah, sure."

DOUG: Hey, I'm Doug. What's up? Well look at that! I just received a text.

"Would you like to sell Organic Chemistry to Ryan for $50?"

That's the price I specified when I listed the book, so I'll go ahead and say "yep."

Now that Skoole has confirmed the match, this number becomes my personal hotline to talk to Doug.

READ MESSAGE

Cool, I'll ask if he can meet me at the student center this afternoon.

"Student center, 3pm?"

DOUG: I'm free then, so I'll say sure and ask him to bring cash.

"Sure thing. Cash?"

And we can continue the conversation to arrange our meeting. No padded envelopes, no shipping labels, no waiting around, no greedy middleman. Just classmates.

We think Skoole is really great and we hope you do too.
